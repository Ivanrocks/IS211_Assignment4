# IS211_Assignment4

This program meassures the time needed for each algorithm to sort or search

### search_compare.py Search Algorithms used
* Sequential Search
* Ordered Sequential Search
* Binary Search Iterative
* Binary Search Recursive

### sort_compare.py Sorting Algorithms used
* Insertion Sort
* Shell Sort
* Python Sort


## Usage

main() function will run the functions for each algorith and then will print
out the average time needed to run each algorithm.

#### Example
##################################################<br>
Size of list: 5000 <br>
Python sort took  0.0000165 seconds to run, on average for a list of 5000 elements. </br>
Insertion sort took  0.0003301 seconds to run, on average for a list of 5000 elements. <br>
Shell sort took  0.0001624 seconds to run, on average for a list of 5000 elements.
